=====================

A data importer that takes a CSV file, let's users define the data types and properties, and hands it over for parsing.

A [demonstration](http://playground.caleydo.org/caleydo_importer/) is available in the Caleydo Playground.

Installation
------------

[Set up a virtual machine using Vagrant](http://www.caleydo.org/documentation/vagrant/) and run these commands inside the virtual machine:

```bash
./manage.sh clone Caleydo/caleydo_importer
./manage.sh resolve
```

If you want this plugin to be dynamically resolved as part of another application of plugin, you need to add it as a peer dependency to the _package.json_ of the application or plugin it should belong to:

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "caleydo_importer": "*"
  }
}
```
